# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-02)

**Core value:** Files never leave the user's device — every PDF operation runs 100% in-browser
**Current focus:** Phase 1 — Split PDF

## Current Position

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Roadmap: Split PDF before Compress PDF — Split has no new library dependencies; establishes section-per-tool pattern
- Roadmap: JSZip required for ZIP download in Phase 1 — without it, 20-page split triggers 20 browser dialogs
- Roadmap: PDF-to-PPTX and PPTX-to-PDF deferred to v2 — out of scope for this milestone
- Architecture: Never use `ignoreEncryption: true` — detect `/Encrypt` in first 2 KB and reject with user message

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Phase 1: Add 80 MB file size gate (warn at 30 MB, block at 80 MB) — prevents tab OOM crash on large PDFs
- Phase 2: Compression is a no-op for text-heavy PDFs — must always show before/after size and display "could not reduce size further" when output is not smaller
- Phase 2: Heavy mode destroys text layer — must warn user before upload, not after
